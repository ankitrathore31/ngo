                <p>GYAN BHARTI SANSTHA believes in helping its customers as far as possible and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:</p>
                <ul class="list-group mb-4">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">GYAN BHARTI SANSTHA does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of the product delivered is not good.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the same to our Customer Service team. The request will be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the issue at their end. This should be reported within <strong>30 days</strong> of receipt of the products.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">If the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must notify our customer service within <strong>30 days</strong> of receiving the product. The Customer Service Team will review your complaint and take an appropriate decision.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">For complaints regarding products with a manufacturer warranty, please refer to the manufacturer.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">In case of any refunds approved by GYAN BHARTI SANSTHA, it will take <strong>3-5 business days</strong> for the refund to be processed to the customer.</li>
                </ul>
